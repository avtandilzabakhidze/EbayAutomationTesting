# EbayAutomationTesting

Welcome to the **EbayAutomationTesting** repository! This project is designed to automate testing for the eBay website using Java, Selenium, and the Page Object Model (POM). This setup ensures a robust, scalable and maintainable test suite.

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate various test cases for the eBay website. It uses Selenium to interact with web elements and the Page Object Model (POM) to manage page elements and actions. POM helps in creating more readable and maintainable test code by separating the test logic from page-specific details.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for writing test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A tool for automating web browser interaction.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern for creating object-oriented classes to represent web pages.
- **TestNG**: Testing framework used for writing and executing tests.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool for managing project dependencies and building the project.
