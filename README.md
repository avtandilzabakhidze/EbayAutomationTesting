EbayAutomationTesting
Welcome to the EbayAutomationTesting repository! This project is designed to automate testing for the eBay website using Java, Selenium and the Page Object Model (POM). This setup ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable test suite.


Project Overview
This project aims to automate various test cases for the eBay website. It uses Selenium to interact with the web elements and Page Object Model (POM) to manage the page elements and actions. POM helps in creating a more readable and maintainable test code by separating the test logic from the page-specific details.

Technologies Used
Java: The programming language used for writing test scripts.
Selenium WebDriver: A tool for automating web browser interaction.
Page Object Model (POM): Design pattern for creating object-oriented classes to represent web pages.
TestNG: Testing frameworks used for writing and executing tests.
Maven: Build automation tool for managing project dependencies and building the project
